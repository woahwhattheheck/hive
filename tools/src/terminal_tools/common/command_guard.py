"""Hard-block terminal commands that kill or launch the user's browser.

Unlike ``destructive_warning`` (advisory — the command still runs), a
guard hit BLOCKS execution before spawn.

Born from the 2026-06-11 incident: workers whose browser TOOLS timed out
— a runtime transport wedge, not a browser problem — ran
``pkill -9 -f chrome`` and ``kill $(ps aux | grep -i chrome ...)``,
killing the user's personal Chrome (every profile, every window) and all
other agents' sessions, then relaunched it on wrong profiles
(``google-chrome --profile-directory=Default``). The browser bridge
attaches to the USER'S running Chrome via an extension: there is nothing
for an agent to "start", and no situation where killing the browser (or
the Hive bridge/gcu runtime) helps.

Reading process info is fine — ``ps aux | grep chrome``, ``pgrep``,
``which google-chrome`` all pass. Only the kill/launch verbs are blocked.
