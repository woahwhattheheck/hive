"""``_ensure_context`` must not silently hand back a differently-bound browser.

A session's tab group lives in exactly ONE Chrome profile, fixed at cold-start.
The bug these tests pin: ``_ensure_context`` computed ``bp`` and then early-
returned the existing context without ever comparing it, so an agent calling
``open --browser-profile product-testing`` on an already-bound session got a tab
in the OLD profile back with ``ok: True``. It then acted on the wrong logged-in
account (observed 2026-08-03: work intended for a product-testing Instagram
session ran against the default profile's account for ~20 minutes).

Silence is the defect, so the mismatch case asserts a raise. The remaining tests
guard the other half — a conflict check that fires on the normal
no-``browser_profile`` path would break every tab-scoped command.
