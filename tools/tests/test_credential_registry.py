"""Tests that enforce credential registry completeness and consistency.

These tests run in CI and catch common mistakes when adding new integrations:
- Missing health checker for a spec with health_check_endpoint
- Orphaned entries in HEALTH_CHECKERS (no corresponding spec)
- CredentialSpec fields that are incomplete
