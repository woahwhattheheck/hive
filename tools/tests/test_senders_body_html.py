"""The email body is TWO fields — `html` and `text` — and both must go out right.

On 2026-07-13 a colony sent 652 outbound emails that arrived as ONE JAMMED
LINE. Nobody wrote bad markup. The bodies were stored correctly in the tracker
as plain text with `\\n` line breaks, but the tool's only body field was called
`html_content` and every provider ships it as `text/html` (Gmail `MIMEText(html,
"html")`, SendGrid `type: text/html`, Mailjet `HTMLPart`). HTML collapses
newlines into whitespace, so greeting, pitch and signature ran together.

The trap was that the send SUCCEEDED — real provider message id, `{"success":
True}`, send log `sent`. The damage was invisible from every vantage point
inside the system; only the recipient's inbox showed it. So the fix is not "tell
the agent to remember": the interface now names both versions explicitly, the
way the ESPs themselves document it, so an agent holding plain text has an
obvious right place to put it and no way to silently mangle it.

`_resolve_body` is that guarantee. If you are about to simplify it back down to
one field, you are re-arming the bug.
