"""The email-senders suite is opt-in, and the gate is registration itself.

Senders are an advanced developer feature (desktop: Settings → Developer). The
gate is deliberately placed at MCP registration rather than at the queen's
allowlist: a tool that was never registered cannot be reached by ANY path — not
the prompt manifest, not `search_tools`, not a hand-edited tools.json, not the
allow-all fallback for unknown queens. With the flag off the model has no way
to learn the feature exists, which is the actual requirement; merely hiding the
Senders page while the tools stayed live would be a fake gate.

These tests fail if someone moves the check to a softer layer, or flips the
default to on.
