"""ColonyRuntime — Orchestrates a colony of parallel worker clones.

Each worker is an exact copy of the queen's AgentLoop — same tools,
same prompt, same LLM. Workers run independently and report results
back to the queen via the event bus.

The ColonyRuntime replaces both AgentHost and ExecutionManager.
There are no graphs, no edges, no nodes, no data buffers.
Just: spawn N independent clones, let them run, collect results.

        (honored at the worker's next iteration boundary, riding the
        existing budget-grace wind-down). Queued workers pick the nominal
        up at promotion; see ``_apply_adaptive_budget``.

        The nominal moves asymmetrically: it shrinks on the composite
        statistical estimate, but raises only on the max-guard — see the
        evidence-driven raise below.

        Sample admission is strict — censored observations must exert
        zero force on the norm:
        - status must be "success" (worker-reported; partial/failed/
          stopped/timeout excluded),
        - budget_limited reports are excluded (the framework cut that
          worker off; its consumption is a censored data point),
        - pinned workers are excluded (explicit queen budget override,
          playbook dispatches, resumed workers, the persistent overseer),
        - zero-call successes are degenerate and excluded.

        Never raises: caller wraps in the subscriber's try/except, and a
        budget-adaptation bug must never break scheduling.

        eager set at spawn (skips the search_tools discovery round-trip for
        tools the caller KNOWS the task needs). Ignored when worker tiering
        is disabled; unknown names are dropped silently.

        ``goal`` — optional queen-authored one-sentence description of what
        this worker is doing, in end-user language. Seeded as the worker
        session's task-list ``meta.goal`` (and recorded in meta.json) so the
        UI can title the worker card before the worker's first turn; the
        worker's own task_create keeps it unless it explicitly passes a
        replacement (the executor's "existing goal is kept" contract).

        By default each spawn uses the colony's own ``agent_spec``,
        ``tools``, and ``tool_executor`` (set at construction). Pass
        the per-spawn override args to spawn a worker that runs
        DIFFERENT code from the colony default — used by the queen's
        ``run_agent_with_input`` tool to spawn the loaded honeycomb /
        custom worker through the unified runtime, instead of going
        through the deprecated ``AgentHost.trigger`` → ``Orchestrator``
        path that silently dropped ``user_request`` via the buffer
        filter.

        ``stream_id`` controls the SSE stream tag the worker's events
        publish under. Default is ``f"worker:{worker_id}"`` (the
        per-spawn unique tag used by parallel fan-out, which the SSE
        filter at routes_events.py drops to keep the queen DM clean
        of worker noise). Pass an explicit value when you want the
        worker's events to bypass that filter and stream to the queen
        DM. ``run_agent_with_input`` passes ``"worker"`` (singular,
        no colon) so the loaded primary worker's tool calls and LLM
        deltas reach the user's chat tab.

        concurrently; this method returns their IDs immediately without
        waiting for completion.

        The overseer's ``run_worker`` tool is the usual

        ``wait_for_worker_reports`` is only used by ``stop_worker`` now,
        which blocks briefly to harvest reports before returning to the
        queen.

        When ``tools_override`` is supplied, every spawned worker
        receives that tool list instead of the colony's default.  Used

        discovery scan picks up, so they show up in ``<available_skills>``

        ``stop_worker`` tool, and colony shutdown.

        Order matters:

        1. **Block new dispatch** (when asked). Without this a queen turn that
           is still running spawns fresh workers *into the middle of the sweep*
           and the stop silently doesn't stick.
        2. **Cancel QUEUED workers.** They never started, so there is no task to
           cancel and they are invisible to a "cancel the running tasks" sweep.
           Left alone, ``_drain_pending_queue`` promotes and *starts* them right
           after the user stopped everything.
        3. **Stop live workers concurrently, each on its own timeout.** One
           worker wedged in a shielded cleanup must not be able to hang the
           sweep (the old code awaited them one at a time, unbounded).
        4. **Reap browsers**, so tab groups don't leak.

        ``worker_ids=None`` means "all of them". Returns a summary the HTTP
        routes hand straight back to the client.

        Dispatch is ALWAYS blocked for the duration of the sweep — otherwise a
        queen turn running concurrently can spawn a worker in between steps 2
        and 3 and it survives the stop. ``block_dispatch=True`` additionally
        *keeps* it blocked afterwards, which is what a user Stop wants (the
        queen is done; nothing more should start until the user speaks again).
        A plain "stop these workers" leaves the queen free to keep working, so
        it restores the previous state on the way out.
