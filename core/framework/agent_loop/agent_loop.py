"""AgentLoop: Multi-turn LLM streaming loop with tool execution and judge evaluation.

Implements AgentProtocol and runs a streaming event loop:
1. Calls LLMProvider.stream() to get streaming events
2. Processes text deltas, tool calls, and finish events
3. Executes tools and feeds results back to the conversation
4. Uses judge evaluation (or implicit stop-reason) to decide loop termination
5. Publishes lifecycle events to EventBus
6. Persists conversation and outputs via write-through to ConversationStore

    - **Text-only turns** (no real tool calls)
      automatically block for user input.  If the LLM is talking to the
      user (not calling tools), it should wait for the user's response
      before the judge runs.
    - **Work turns** (tool calls) flow through without blocking —
      the LLM is making progress, not asking the user.
    - A synthetic ``ask_user`` tool is also injected for explicit
      blocking when the LLM wants to be deliberate about requesting
      input (e.g. mid-tool-call).

    Always returns AgentResult with retryable=False semantics. The executor
    must NOT retry event loop nodes -- retry is handled internally by the
    judge (RETRY action continues the loop). See WP-7 enforcement.
