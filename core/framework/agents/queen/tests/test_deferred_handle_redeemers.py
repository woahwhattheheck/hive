"""A handle-emitting tool and the tools that redeem its handles must ship together.

Several terminal tools return a deferred-result handle instead of the result
itself:

* ``terminal_exec`` → ``output_handle`` when output overflows
  ``max_output_kb``; redeemed by ``terminal_output_get``.
* ``terminal_job_start`` → ``job_id``; redeemed by ``terminal_job_logs`` /
  ``terminal_job_manage``.

Splitting a handle from its redeemer across tool tiers is the bug this file
exists to prevent: the agent receives a handle-shaped string it has no tool
to cash, and the failure surfaces as truncated output (or a stranded job)
rather than an error. The desktop runtime burned >20 minutes of a production
session on exactly this before adding the same invariant there. Pruning a
redeemer for token cost is a false economy — the handle it redeems is dead
weight without it.

The OTHER deferred path — a slow command — is deliberately not modelled
here: the agent loop dispatches ``terminal_exec`` via
``LoopConfig.background_tools`` and the agent collects through the
synthetic ``collect_result``, which bypasses the category allowlist
entirely. ``test_terminal_exec_is_dispatched_in_background`` pins that
arrangement.
